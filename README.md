<h1 align="center">EU-FOSSA OSS Hackathon 2019</h1>

The [EU-FOSSA](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eu-fossa-2/about) project developed by [European institutions](https://europa.eu/) is aiming at improving the security of Open Source Software.

As part of EU-FOSSA 2, the [European Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/) is organising several [hackathons](https://eufossahackathon.bemyapp.com/) where developers from both the projects and the European Institutions that rely on their software, can come together.

The third EU-FOSSA Hackathon is focused on the European Commission's open source activity - and a handful of projects have been invited to participate, as well as key technical experts from the open source communities.

The event will be held in Brussels at Silversquare Triomphe, during the weekend of 5th & 6th October 2019.
